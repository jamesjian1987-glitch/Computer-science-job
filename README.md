Hi, I'm a computer science student focusing on data analytics. I enjoy working with data to solve real problems and help people make better decisions. This portfolio shows my recent project on quantitative trading strategy analysis.

I built a backtesting system to test a small-cap stock strategy using Python and historical market data. The idea was to see if buying stocks with lower market caps could beat the market.

What I did:
- Pulled 2 years of stock data using Python (Pandas/NumPy)
- Wrote SQL queries to filter stocks by market cap and track performance
- Built a backtesting engine to simulate trades with realistic commission costs
- Visualized results to compare strategy return vs benchmark
- Wrote an ai translation tool

What I learned:
- Real trading costs (commissions, slippage) matter a lot in backtesting
- Small-cap stocks can generate excess returns but come with higher risk
- Clean data is everything - spent more time cleaning than coding

Skills

Technical:
- SQL (complex joins, window functions, query optimization)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib for analysis)
- Excel (pivot tables, VLOOKUP, basic modeling)
- Tableau/Power BI (dashboard creation)
- Statistics (hypothesis testing, regression basics)
- AI (Chatgpt, Deepseek, Doubao)

Soft Skills:
- Can explain technical findings to non-technical people
- Good at breaking down vague problems into concrete steps
- Comfortable with deadlines and juggling multiple tasks

Next Steps for This Project

1. Add more technical indicators (MACD, RSI) for entry/exit timing
2. Try machine learning to predict which small-caps will outperform
3. Test the strategy with real-time paper trading
